# GPT-5.2: OpenAI's Counterattack with Three-Model Architecture

On December 11, 2025, OpenAI announced its latest AI model family "GPT-5.2." Following CEO Sam Altman's "Code Red" memo issued internally, this release is clearly aimed at countering Google's Gemini 3 and Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5.

## Three-Model Architecture

GPT-5.2 is available in three versions:

### Instant
- Optimized for fast responses
- For everyday tasks like information retrieval, writing, and translation
- Available at the lowest cost

### Thinking
- Specialized for complex structured work like coding, math, and planning
- Excels at step-by-step logical reasoning
- Inherits o3 technology

### Pro
- For difficult problems requiring highest accuracy and reliability
- Used when higher quality answers are needed
- Enterprise-focused

## New "GDPval" Benchmark

OpenAI introduced a new benchmark "GDPval" measuring professional knowledge work tasks across 44 occupations:

| Model | GDPval (Human Expert Level or Above) |
|-------|-------------------------------------|
| GPT-5.2 Thinking | **70.9%** |
| Gemini 3 Pro | 53.3% |

### Specific Improvements

Spreadsheet modeling task performed by investment bank junior analysts:
- **GPT-5.1**: 59.1%
- **GPT-5.2**: 68.4% (+9.3% improvement)

## Performance Improvements

- **Error Rate**: **30% reduction** from previous generation
- **Response Speed**: 2x faster with Instant model
- **Context**: Up to 256K tokens supported

## Competitive Environment

Applications CEO Fidji Simo stated "these upgrades have been in development for months," claiming the release was not rushed in response to Google.

Meanwhile, Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 recorded higher scores on SWE-Bench Verified, but OpenAI argues that test "is not representative of real-world use."

## Future Developments

- **ChatGPT "Adult Mode"**: Planned for Q1 2026
- **Paid User Rollout**: Sequential deployment
- **API Availability**: Immediately available for developers

With the GPT-5.2 release, the three-way competition between OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic has further intensified. The AI market at the end of 2025 has become the most competitive environment in history.
