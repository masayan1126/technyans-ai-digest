# GPT-4 Turbo Release

On November 6, 2023, OpenAI announced GPT-4 Turbo at its developer conference "DevDay." This release became an important milestone that significantly improved the practicality of large language models (LLMs).

## Key Features

### 1. Massive Context Window
GPT-4 Turbo achieved a 128,000 token context window (equivalent to about 300 pages). This was a 16x expansion from the previous GPT-4's 8,192 tokens, enabling analysis of long documents and complex conversations.

### 2. Cost Reduction
Input token costs were reduced to one-third, and output token costs to half of the previous pricing. This made AI adoption more economical for enterprises.

### 3. Updated Knowledge Base
The training data cutoff was updated to April 2023, enabling responses based on more current information.

### 4. Multimodal Capabilities
Integrated image recognition functionality, allowing it to handle complex tasks combining text and images.

## Impact

The release of GPT-4 Turbo brought about the following changes:

- **Expansion of Enterprise Applications**: Cost reduction made AI adoption realistic even for small and medium-sized businesses
- **Innovation in Long-Text Processing**: Analysis of legal documents, medical records, and research papers became practical
- **Growth of Developer Ecosystem**: Lower API prices reduced barriers to entry for startups

## Paradigm Shift

This release marked an important turning point where AI transitioned from an "experimental tool" to a "practical business tool." In particular, the improved long-text processing capability significantly contributed to improving the work efficiency of knowledge workers.
