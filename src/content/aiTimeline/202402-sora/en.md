# Sora: OpenAI's Video Generation AI

On February 15, 2024, OpenAI announced the revolutionary video generation AI "Sora." Its ability to generate high-quality videos up to 60 seconds long from text prompts opened new horizons in AI technology.

## Sora's Astonishing Capabilities

### 1. Long Video Generation
While conventional video generation AI could only produce a few seconds, Sora can generate coherent videos up to 60 seconds long.

### 2. Understanding Physical Laws
- Realistic light reflection and shadow expression
- Accurate simulation of object inertia and gravity
- Natural camera angle changes
- Maintenance of temporal consistency

### 3. Complex Scene Generation
- Multiple characters and objects
- Complex background and foreground interactions
- Emotional expression and character consistency

## Technical Breakthrough

Sora adopts the "Diffusion Transformer," applying the Transformer architecture to video generation:

- **Space-Time Patches**: Dividing video into patches in both space and time
- **Scalability**: Quality improves as model size increases
- **Multiple Resolution Support**: Handles different aspect ratios and resolutions

## Examples of Published Demo Videos

1. **Woman Walking in Tokyo**: Realistic urban crowds and light reflections
2. **Pirate Ship Adventure**: Complex water movement and ship physics
3. **Shiba Inu Playing in Snow**: Natural animal movement and snow texture

## Impact and Challenges

### Positive Impact
- **Democratization of Video Production**: Video production possible without expensive equipment or large production teams
- **Educational Content**: Easy creation of teaching materials that visually explain complex concepts
- **Prototyping**: Checking movie and commercial storyboards with video

### Concerns
- **Deepfakes**: Easy creation of fake videos
- **Copyright**: Training data copyright issues
- **Employment Impact**: Potential reduction in video production jobs

## OpenAI's Cautious Approach

Sora was not publicly released at the initial announcement:

- **Limited Access**: Provided only to creators and researchers
- **Safety Assessment**: Evaluation of potential misuse through red teaming
- **Watermarking**: Consideration of mechanisms to indicate AI-generated videos

## Subsequent Developments

- **December 2024**: Gradual public release to general users began
- **Competition Emerges**: Google (Veo), Meta, RunwayML also entered video generation AI competition
- **2025**: Further quality improvements and longer video generation became possible

Sora's emergence heralded the arrival of an era where "creative activities by AI" become reality and collaboration between human creativity and AI becomes mainstream.
