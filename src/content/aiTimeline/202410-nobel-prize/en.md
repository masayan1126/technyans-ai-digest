# AI Researchers Win Nobel Prize

On October 8, 2024, the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences announced it would award the Nobel Prize to two pioneers in AI research. This recognition marked a historic moment when AI research was acknowledged as mainstream science.

## Recipients and Reasons

### Geoffrey Hinton (Physics Prize)
**Father of Deep Learning**

- **Award Reason**: Foundational discoveries and inventions in machine learning for artificial neural networks
- **Main Achievements**:
  - Practical implementation of backpropagation
  - Development of Boltzmann machines
  - Invention of dropout techniques
  - Made deep learning practical
- **Affiliation**: University of Toronto (formerly Google)

### Demis Hassabis (Chemistry Prize)
**Creator of AlphaFold**

- **Award Reason**: Development of the revolutionary AI system "AlphaFold" for protein structure prediction
- **Main Achievements**:
  - Predicted 3D protein structures with high accuracy using AlphaFold2
  - Published over 200 million protein structures
  - Accelerated drug discovery and biological research
  - Solved a 50-year-old problem in biology
- **Affiliation**: CEO of Google DeepMind

## Why It Was Important

### 1. Establishing AI's Scientific Standing
The Nobel Prize recognition elevated AI from an "experimental technology" to "mainstream science." This meant:
- Justification for funding AI research
- Encouraging young researchers to enter the AI field
- Elevated status of AI research in academia

### 2. Reaffirming the Importance of Basic Research
Both Hinton and Hassabis focused on long-term basic research rather than short-term commercial profits. This award proved the value of basic research.

### 3. Success Model for Interdisciplinary Research
- **Hinton**: Neuroscience × Computer Science
- **Hassabis**: Neuroscience × AI × Biology

Demonstrated the importance of research that fuses different fields.

## Hinton's Acceptance Speech
In his acceptance speech, Hinton also warned about AI dangers:

> "I may have created something wonderful for humanity, but I may have also created something very dangerous."

He publicly expressed his concerns about AI safety as the reason for leaving OpenAI.

## AlphaFold's Impact

Hassabis's AlphaFold had the following impact on biology:

### Before AlphaFold
- Takes years to decades to determine one protein structure
- Requires expensive experimental facilities and expert teams
- Only about 200,000 protein structures determined worldwide

### After AlphaFold
- Predicts protein structures in minutes to hours
- Free and available to anyone
- Published over 200 million protein structures
- Dramatically accelerated drug discovery research

## Impact

### Academic World
- Increased investment in AI research
- Rush to establish AI departments and research institutes at top universities
- Elevated social status of AI researchers

### Industry
- Intensified competition for AI talent
- Increased corporate investment in basic research
- Heightened interest in AI ethics and safety

### Society
- Improved public awareness of AI
- Recognition of AI education importance
- Active AI regulation debates

## Subsequent Developments

- **December 2024**: AlphaFold3 release (enhanced application to drug discovery)
- **2025**: Global increase in AI safety research investment
- AI researchers win other science prizes successively

This award symbolized that AI has become an indispensable tool for human knowledge and progress.
