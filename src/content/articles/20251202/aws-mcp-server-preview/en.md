## AWS Announces MCP Server for AI Agents

Amazon Web Services has announced the preview availability of "AWS MCP Server," a new service for comprehensively utilizing AWS from AI agents and LLMs, at AWS re:Invent 2025.

## What is MCP?

MCP (Model Context Protocol) is a protocol used when generative AI and AI agents call external tools to retrieve or manipulate information. The AI acts as an MCP client, while the target system functions as an MCP server.

## AWS MCP Server Overview

AWS MCP Server integrates and encompasses the following servers that were previously provided separately:

- **AWS API MCP Server**: For utilizing AWS APIs
- **AWS Knowledge MCP Server**: For accessing the knowledge base

With this new service, calls to **over 15,000 AWS APIs** and access to AWS documentation become possible from generative AI and AI agents.

## Three Key Features

### Agent SOP Tools

AI agents can retrieve Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for properly operating target resources. Access to documents containing workflows and best practices is available.

### AWS API Tools

Under automated credential management, most of AWS's 15,000+ APIs can be called with proper syntax verification and error handling. Help on descriptions and syntax for new AWS APIs not included in AI training data can also be obtained.

### AWS Knowledge Tools

The following AWS resources are accessible:

- Official documentation
- API references
- Blog articles
- What's new announcements
- Architecture guidance
- Region listings and health status

## Benefits for Developers

### Immediate Access to Latest APIs

Even when new services are released, developers can obtain information and usage methods for the latest APIs without waiting for AI training data updates.

### Unified Access

Previously, multiple MCP servers needed to be configured individually, but AWS MCP Server provides comprehensive access through a single integration.

### Secure Authentication Management

Credential management is automated, enabling secure API calls.

## Future Outlook

AWS MCP Server is currently in preview. As automation of cloud infrastructure management by AI agents progresses, MCP-based integration tools like this are expected to significantly contribute to developer productivity.

AWS has announced numerous other AI-related services at re:Invent 2025, further accelerating the fusion of AI and cloud.
