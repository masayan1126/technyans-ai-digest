# Anthropic Expands Labs Team with Instagram Co-founder Mike Krieger

Anthropic has announced the expansion of its Labs team, a dedicated group focused on incubating experimental products at the frontier of Claude's capabilities. The announcement includes the significant news that Mike Krieger, co-founder of Instagram, is joining Labs after spending two years as Anthropic's Chief Product Officer.

## New Structure for Innovation

Labs will be led by Krieger alongside Ben Mann, with the team focused on discovering experimental products that push the boundaries of what Claude can do. Ami Vora, who joined Anthropic at the end of 2025, will take over leadership of the Product organization, partnering with CTO Rahul Patil to scale Claude experiences for millions of users.

"The speed of advancement in AI demands a different approach to how we build, how we organize, and where we focus," said Daniela Amodei, President of Anthropic. "Labs gives us room to break the mold and explore."

## Building at the Frontier

The expanded Labs team represents Anthropic's commitment to exploring new possibilities while maintaining responsible development practices. The company stated it is now structured to support both discovering experimental products at the frontier of Claude's capabilities and scaling them responsibly for enterprise customers and growing user base.

Krieger brings invaluable experience from building Instagram into one of the world's most successful social platforms. His design-first approach and track record of creating products that resonate with users is expected to drive innovation within Labs.

## Active Hiring

Anthropic announced it is actively hiring builders with a track record of creating products people love and shaping emerging technology with care. The company is seeking those who want to build at the very frontier of AI capabilities.

## Recent Momentum

The Labs expansion comes amid a flurry of activity from Anthropic. The company recently launched Claude for Healthcare and Claude Cowork, demonstrating its commitment to both specialized enterprise solutions and broader productivity tools.
