## App Store Arrives Inside ChatGPT

OpenAI announced on December 18 that it has opened a new app directory within ChatGPT. Developers can now submit their apps for review and potential publication. The move has been dubbed an "app store" and is drawing comparisons to the transformative 2008 iPhone App Store launch.

## Expanding ChatGPT's Capabilities Through Apps

OpenAI first announced the addition of apps to ChatGPT in October, and the company has now officially opened its doors to developers.

According to OpenAI:

> "Apps extend ChatGPT conversations by bringing in new context and letting users take actions like order groceries, turn an outline into a slide deck, or search for an apartment."

## Available App Integrations

The ChatGPT app store currently features integrations with notable services including:

- **Adobe Photoshop**
- **Apple Music**
- **Slack**
- And many more

## Developer SDK

OpenAI's Apps SDK is currently available in beta, providing a toolkit for developers looking to create new experiences for ChatGPT users.

## Entering the Platform Era

This move is seen as part of OpenAI's strategy to evolve ChatGPT from a simple AI chatbot into a full-fledged platform. Just as Apple's App Store transformed the iPhone, ChatGPT's app store has the potential to fundamentally change how users interact with AI assistants.

## ChatGPT Mobile App Surpasses $3 Billion in Revenue

In related news, the ChatGPT mobile app has surpassed $3 billion in consumer spending worldwide. This demonstrates the rapid shift of users toward paid AI services, and the app store launch could further accelerate this momentum.
