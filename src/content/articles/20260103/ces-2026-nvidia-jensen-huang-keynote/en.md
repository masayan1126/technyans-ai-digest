## CES 2026 Opens Soon

The world's largest technology event, CES 2026, will be held in Las Vegas from January 6-9. This year's theme is "technology that's already here"—the question is no longer whether AI will transform consumer products, but how quickly.

## NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang's Keynote

On Monday, January 5, NVIDIA founder and CEO Jensen Huang will deliver a 90-minute keynote at the Fontainebleau hotel.

Sources say the presentation will describe a roadmap for how NVIDIA's full stack will drive the next industrial revolution:

- **Generative AI** - Text, image, and code generation
- **Physical AI** - AI operating in the physical world
- **Robotics** - Humanoid robots, industrial robotics
- **Gaming** - New GPUs and related technologies

## The Physical AI Era

Physical AI and robotics will take center stage at this year's CES:

- Humanoid robot exhibitions
- AI-powered drones
- Self-driving vehicles
- Robotic arm demonstrations

NVIDIA is also hosting a joint session with Accenture titled "Physical AI and the Big Bang of General Robotics."

## CES 2026 Highlights

Gary Shapiro, CEO of CTA (Consumer Technology Association), stated:

> CES 2026 is where innovators show up—to connect, forge partnerships, and do business on a global scale

Key focus areas this year:
- **AI** - From generative AI to agentic AI
- **Robotics** - Home and industrial robots
- **Digital Health** - AI diagnostics and monitoring
- **Mobility** - Autonomous vehicles and EVs
- **Quantum Computing** - Featured at the new CES Foundry

## Changes from Last Year

Last year, Huang delivered a massive keynote at the Michelob Ultra Arena, debuting new gaming chips, the desktop-sized AI rig "Digits," and various AI software services. Chip makers are expected to lead the show again this year.

## How to Watch

The NVIDIA keynote will be livestreamed. Details are available on NVIDIA's official website.
