# OpenAI Plans Q4 2026 IPO in Race Against Anthropic to Go Public

OpenAI is actively preparing for an initial public offering in the fourth quarter of 2026, according to a report by The Wall Street Journal published on January 29. The $500 billion AI startup has begun informal discussions with Wall Street banks as it races to beat rival Anthropic to public markets.

## Building the Financial Team

OpenAI has been strengthening its financial leadership in anticipation of the IPO. Recent key hires include Ajmere Dale as Chief Accounting Officer and Cynthia Gaylor to lead investor relations. These appointments signal the company's serious intent to meet the rigorous financial reporting requirements of a publicly traded company.

## SoftBank's Expanding Investment

Alongside IPO preparations, SoftBank is reportedly in discussions to invest an additional $30 billion in OpenAI. This would further solidify the Japanese conglomerate's position as one of OpenAI's largest backers and reflects continued confidence in the company's trajectory despite its significant cash burn rate.

## The Anthropic Factor

The race to go public is not just about capital—it's also about perception and market positioning. Anthropic, OpenAI's primary competitor founded by former OpenAI executives, is reportedly pursuing its own path to public markets. Being first to IPO could establish significant advantages in attracting institutional investment and public visibility.

## Market Context

The planned IPO comes amid ongoing debate about AI industry valuations. OpenAI has faced scrutiny over its profitability timeline, with the company burning through an estimated $17 billion in recent years. A successful public offering would need to convince public market investors—who tend to demand clearer paths to profitability than private backers—of OpenAI's long-term financial viability.
