# Google Adds Gemini AI Features to Gmail for 3 Billion Users

Google is rolling out Gemini AI features to Gmail, which now has more than 3 billion users. Some AI features will be turned on by default, meaning users will need to opt out if they don't want them.

## New AI-Powered Features

The update brings several Gemini-powered capabilities to the email platform:

### AI Overviews
Users can now get AI-generated summaries of long email threads and ask questions about their inbox using natural language. This makes it easier to catch up on lengthy discussions without reading every message.

### Smart Writing Assistance
- **Help Me Write**: AI-assisted email composition
- **Suggested Replies**: Quick response options generated by AI
- **Proofread**: Grammar and style checking powered by Gemini

### AI Inbox Filtering
A new AI Inbox feature will intelligently filter out unimportant emails, surfacing only what matters most to users. This goes beyond traditional spam filtering to understand email relevance.

## Powered by Gemini 3

Many of these improvements are made possible by Gemini 3, Google's latest large language model. The new capabilities have begun rolling out to Gmail users as well as Google AI Pro and Ultra subscribers.

## Opt-Out Options

For users who prefer their inbox without AI assistance, Google has confirmed that all features can be disabled. However, there's a catch: disabling AI in Gmail requires disabling Gmail smart features entirely, which also turns off inbox tabs and messages sorted by type.

This bundling of AI with existing smart features may frustrate users who want traditional Gmail organization without the new AI additions.

## Part of Broader Gemini Integration

The Gmail update is part of Google's broader strategy to integrate Gemini across its product suite. At CES 2026, the company also showcased new Gemini features for Google TV, including conversational queries, Deep Dives for topic exploration, and integration with Nano Banana image generation.
