# Anthropic Signs $10B Funding Round at $350B Valuation

Anthropic, the AI safety company behind Claude, has signed a term sheet for a massive $10 billion funding round that would value the company at $350 billion, nearly doubling its valuation from just three months ago.

## Rapid Valuation Growth

The Claude maker last raised a $13 billion Series F round at a $183 billion valuation in late 2025. This new round represents an extraordinary 91% increase in valuation in just one quarter, reflecting the intense competition and investor appetite in the AI sector.

## Lead Investors

Coatue Management and GIC, Singapore's sovereign wealth fund, will lead the new funding round. Both are established technology investors with significant portfolios in the AI space.

## The "Do More With Less" Strategy

Inside Anthropic headquarters, President and co-founder Daniela Amodei keeps coming back to a phrase that's become a governing principle: "Do more with less."

In a recent CNBC interview, Amodei explained: "Anthropic has always had a fraction of what our competitors have had in terms of compute and capital, and yet, pretty consistently, we've had the most powerful, most performant models for the majority of the past several years."

This philosophy directly challenges the prevailing Silicon Valley mindset where the biggest labs and their backers treat scale as destiny.

## Enterprise Momentum

The funding comes as Anthropic continues to expand its enterprise footprint. The company recently announced its first enterprise deal of 2026 with Allianz, which includes building custom AI agents and providing Claude Code access to all employees.

## Claude Code's Developer Reception

The engineering community has been buzzing about Claude Code. Google Principal Engineer Jaana Dogan reports that Claude Code generated a distributed agent orchestration system in just one hour - a problem Google had been working on since last year.

This kind of endorsement from major tech company engineers reinforces Anthropic's position in the AI race, demonstrating it's not simply a binary battle between Google and OpenAI.
