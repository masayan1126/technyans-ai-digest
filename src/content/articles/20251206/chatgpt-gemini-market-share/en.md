## ChatGPT: Three Years Later

Three years have passed since OpenAI released ChatGPT in late November 2022. What started as a "rough and tentative idea" using GPT-3.5 has grown into the world's most popular AI chatbot.

However, according to reports from the Washington Post and TechCrunch, ChatGPT's dominant position is beginning to slip.

## Growth Slowdown is Clear

According to data from market research firm Sensor Tower:

- **ChatGPT**: Approximately 810 million monthly active users, up 180% year-over-year
- However, **growth from August to November was only about 6%**, plateauing
- **Gemini**: Grew approximately 30% during the same period

Over the past seven months (May-November 2025), Gemini increased its share of the overall AI chatbot market by 3 percentage points.

## Why Gemini is Surging

Key factors driving Google Gemini's rapid growth:

- Release of new image generation models like **Nano Banana**
- Convenient integration with Samsung devices
- Gemini 3 topping industry benchmarks
- Improved user perception of reliability and integration

Users particularly cite Gemini's integration and reliability on Samsung devices as reasons for preferring it over ChatGPT.

## A Turning Point for the AI Industry

ChatGPT sparked the AI revolution, but three years later, industry competition has entered a new phase. While OpenAI still maintains the largest user base, competition with Google's Gemini, Anthropic's Claude, and other players has intensified.

The question now is whether ChatGPT can fulfill OpenAI's original mission of bringing "progress, health, and sustainability to the world," or whether it will lose its edge in the fierce competition ahead.
