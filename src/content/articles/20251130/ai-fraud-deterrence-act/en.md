On November 25, 2025, a bipartisan "AI Fraud Deterrence Act" was introduced in the U.S. Congress. This bill aims to significantly strengthen penalties for fraud using AI-generated content and criminalize impersonation of federal officials.

## Bill Overview

### Sponsors

This bill was introduced with bipartisan support:

- **Rep. Ted Lieu** (California, Democrat)
- **Rep. Neal Dunn** (Florida, Republican)

### Background

The bill was introduced following a series of serious fraud incidents in Washington. In May 2025, The Wall Street Journal reported that federal authorities were investigating fraudulent calls and texts sent to senators, governors, business leaders, and other VIPs from someone impersonating White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles' voice and number.

## Key Penalty Provisions

### Bank Fraud

Penalties for bank fraud using AI tools:

| Item | Current Law | New Bill |
|------|-------------|----------|
| Maximum Prison | - | **30 years** |
| Maximum Fine | $250,000 | **$2 million** |

### Wire Fraud, Mail Fraud, and Money Laundering

Penalties for AI-assisted wire fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering:

- **Maximum Prison**: 20 years
- **Maximum Fine**: $1 million

### Impersonation of Federal Officials

The bill also newly criminalizes impersonation of federal officials:

- **Prison**: Up to 3 years
- **Fine**: Up to $1 million

### Comparison with Current Law

Under current law, the maximum fine for fraud is $250,000, with a maximum of $1 million only if the fraud affects disaster aid or a financial institution. Under the new bill, fraud committed using AI would see fines raised to $1 million.

## Definition of AI

The bill adopts the definition of artificial intelligence from the 2020 National AI Initiative Act. This ensures legal consistency.

## First Amendment Protections

The bill includes important exemptions to protect First Amendment rights (freedom of expression):

- **Satire**: AI-generated satirical content is protected
- **Parody**: Parody works are also protected
- **Clear Disclosures**: Expressive content with clear disclosures is exempt

This allows for cracking down on malicious fraud while minimizing impact on creative expression and journalism.

## Types of Crimes Targeted

### Deepfake Fraud

- Fraud using AI-generated audio, video, or text
- Impersonating celebrities or public figures to steal money
- Fraud through fake audio/video messages

### Federal Official Impersonation Fraud

- AI-fabricated voices or images of government officials
- Sending fake government notices or warnings
- Fraudulent collection of taxes or fines

### Financial Fraud

- Bank fraud using AI-generated fake documents
- Automated phishing attacks
- AI-assisted identity verification fraud

## Future Outlook

### Congressional Review

Since the bill is introduced with bipartisan support, it is well-positioned to gain support from both parties. With growing concerns about the increase in AI fraud, early passage is expected.

### Enforcement Challenges

Even if the bill passes, the following challenges remain:

1. **Detection of AI-Generated Content**: Developing detection methods to counter advancing AI technology
2. **International Enforcement**: Responding to fraud from overseas
3. **Keeping Pace with Technology**: The need for laws to keep up with technological progress

## Current State of AI Fraud

### Increasing Damage

With advances in AI technology, AI fraud damage has surged:

- **Voice Cloning Fraud**: Scam calls mimicking the voices of family or acquaintances
- **Business Email Compromise**: Fraudulent wire transfer instructions impersonating CEOs or executives
- **Romance Scams**: Fraud using AI-generated photos and videos

### Scale of Damage

According to FBI reports, AI-related fraud damage has increased significantly from 2024 to 2025, causing billions of dollars in losses to businesses and individuals.

## Summary

The AI Fraud Deterrence Act is an important legislative measure to address the increase in AI fraud:

1. **Bipartisan Support**: Supported by both Democratic and Republican parties
2. **Strict Penalties**: Up to 30 years imprisonment, $2 million fine
3. **Criminalization of Federal Official Impersonation**: Addition of new crime category
4. **Protection of Free Expression**: Satire and parody protected as exceptions
5. **Triggered by Actual Incident**: Introduced following White House official impersonation case

With the advancement of AI technology, the development of legal frameworks has become urgent. This bill represents an important step in fraud prevention in the AI era.
