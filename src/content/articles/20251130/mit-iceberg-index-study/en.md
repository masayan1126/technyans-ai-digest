A study conducted using the "Iceberg Index," a labor market simulation tool jointly developed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, has revealed that AI can already replace 11.7% of the U.S. labor force, representing approximately $1.2 trillion in wages.

## What is the Iceberg Index?

The Iceberg Index is an innovative tool developed by MIT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory to measure AI's impact on the labor market.

### Technical Features

- **Skills-Centered KPI**: Measures the percentage of wage value of skills that AI systems can perform within each occupation
- **Digital Twin**: Treats America's 151 million-plus workers as individual agents, categorized by skills, tasks, occupation, and location
- **Comprehensive Mapping**: Maps more than 32,000 skills and 923 occupations across 3,000 counties

Prasanna Balaprakash, ORNL director and co-leader of the research, explained: "Basically, we are creating a digital twin for the U.S. labor market."

## Key Findings

### Surface vs. Submerged Impact

The research uses the "iceberg" metaphor to explain AI's impact on the labor market:

**Visible Impact (Tip of the Iceberg)**
- Layoffs and role shifts in tech, computing, and IT
- Represents 2.2% of total wage exposure (approximately $211 billion)
- Affects 1.9 million workers
- Concentrated in California, Virginia, and Washington

**Submerged Impact (Full Iceberg Index)**
- Routine functions in HR, logistics, finance, and office administration
- Equivalent to $1.2 trillion in annual wages and 17.7 million jobs
- Spans finance, healthcare, and professional services

### Geographic Impact

The Iceberg Index challenges the common assumption that AI risk only affects the tech sector and coastal areas:

- **All 50 States Affected**: Including inland and rural regions
- **Surprising States at Top**: South Dakota, Utah, and Delaware are among the most affected by automation of Iceberg Index jobs
- **Coastal vs. Inland Differences**: Surface impact concentrates on coasts, but deeper impact is distributed nationwide

## Policy Applications

The Iceberg Index is also being used as a tool for policymakers and business leaders to stress-test various scenarios.

### Real-World Applications

- **Tennessee**: Cited the Iceberg Index in its official AI Workforce Action Plan released this month
- **North Carolina**: Evaluating how AI might reshape its workforce
- **Utah**: Using the platform to analyze workforce impact

### Contributions to Policy Making

Policymakers can use the Iceberg Index for decision-making on:

- Training budget allocation
- Infrastructure investment direction
- New regulation development

## Affected Sectors

According to the research, the following sectors are particularly vulnerable:

| Sector | Impact Level |
|--------|--------------|
| Financial Services | High |
| Healthcare | High |
| Professional Services | High |
| Human Resources | High |
| Logistics | Medium-High |
| Office Administration | High |

## Future Outlook

This research provides critical guidance for predicting how the labor market will change as AI adoption progresses and for taking appropriate measures.

### Preparations to Make

1. **Skills Reassessment**: Identify and acquire skills that are difficult for AI to replace
2. **Regional Economic Diversification**: Review dependence on AI-vulnerable industries
3. **Proactive Policy**: Develop preemptive measures using the Iceberg Index

## Summary

The MIT and Oak Ridge National Laboratory Iceberg Index study indicates that AI's impact on the labor market may be broader and more serious than previously thought:

1. **11.7% of Workforce Affected**: 17.7 million people, $1.2 trillion scale
2. **Tip of the Iceberg**: Surface tech industry impact is only 2.2% of the total
3. **All 50 States Impacted**: Not just coastal areas but also inland and rural regions
4. **Used as Policy Tool**: Multiple states including Tennessee have adopted it

The AI-driven transformation of the labor market is no longer a distant future scenario but a reality unfolding now. It is urgent for businesses, governments, and individuals to prepare for this change.
