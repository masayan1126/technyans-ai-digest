## Gemini Deep Research Enhances Visualization Capabilities

On December 16, Google announced new visualization features for the "Deep Research" function in the Gemini app. This feature, available to AI Ultra subscribers, enables instant visualization of complex information.

## New Feature: Visual Reports

### Auto-Generated Visual Elements
Deep Research can now generate "visual reports" that include the following visual elements in addition to traditional text:

- **Custom Images**: Automatically generated images tailored to research content
- **Charts and Graphs**: Visual representation of data
- **Interactive Simulations**: Dynamic representation of complex theories and processes

## Use Cases

According to Google, the feature is particularly effective for:

- **Marketing Budget Allocation Analysis**: Visualization and simulation of budget distribution
- **Exploring Complex Scientific Theories**: Visual understanding of abstract concepts
- **Data-Driven Decision Making**: Trend analysis through graphs and charts

"Whether you're allocating a marketing budget or exploring complex scientific theories, it will illustrate your findings," Google explained.

## For AI Ultra Subscribers

This new feature is available to Gemini AI Ultra plan subscribers. Following Google's preview last week of Deep Research upgrades and developer agent availability, this represents the concrete feature expansion.

## Intensifying Competition with OpenAI

This announcement coincides with OpenAI's release of their new image generation model "GPT Image 1.5" on the same day. This demonstrates the escalating feature competition between the two companies.
