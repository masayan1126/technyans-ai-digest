# Google Says No Ads for Gemini as ChatGPT Begins Ad Testing

Just days after OpenAI announced it would begin testing advertisements on ChatGPT, Google has taken a distinctly different approach. Dan Taylor, Google's Vice President of Global Ads, told Business Insider that there are no plans to introduce advertising to the Gemini app.

## Different Roles, Different Strategies

Taylor emphasized that Gemini and Google Search serve fundamentally different purposes. While Search helps users discover new information including commercial interests like products and services, Gemini is positioned as an AI assistant focused on helping users create, analyze, and complete tasks.

This distinction reflects a deliberate strategic choice by Google to keep Gemini free from commercial influence, potentially appealing to users who prioritize an uninterrupted AI assistant experience.

## ChatGPT's Traffic Decline

The announcement comes at a critical time for the AI chatbot market. According to data from SimilarWeb, ChatGPT's daily visits have declined significantly in recent weeks. Between December 2025 and early January 2026, ChatGPT's seven-day average dropped from around 203 million daily visits to approximately 158 million.

In contrast, Gemini's traffic remained stable at around 55-60 million daily visits during the same period, suggesting Google's AI offering is maintaining its user base while ChatGPT faces headwinds.

## The Monetization Dilemma

OpenAI's decision to introduce ads reflects the company's challenging financial position. With approximately $1.4 trillion in funding requirements over the next decade and intense competition from both Gemini and Anthropic's Claude, advertising represents a significant new revenue stream.

For Google, the calculation is different. The company already generates substantial advertising revenue from its core Search business, allowing Gemini to remain ad-free while still contributing to the broader Google ecosystem.

## What This Means for Users

Users now face a clear choice between platforms with different value propositions:

- **ChatGPT**: Free tier with ads, or paid subscriptions for ad-free experience
- **Gemini**: Ad-free experience across all tiers

This divergence may influence user preferences, particularly among those who find advertising intrusive in AI assistant interactions.
