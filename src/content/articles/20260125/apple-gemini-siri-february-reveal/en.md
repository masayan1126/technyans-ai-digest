# Apple to Unveil Gemini-Powered Siri in February: Two-Year Promise Finally Delivered

According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman's latest reporting, Apple plans to unveil its new Google Gemini-powered Siri in the second half of February. Features announced at WWDC 2024 but delayed due to technical challenges are finally coming to fruition.

## New Features Coming in iOS 26.4

The new Siri will be part of iOS 26.4, expected in beta in February with general release in March or early April. Gurman reports Apple may hold private briefings or a dedicated event to demonstrate the functionality.

### Key New Capabilities

- **Personal Context**: Reference previous conversations and understand context
- **On-Screen Awareness**: Understand what's displayed on screen
- **In-App Actions**: Execute app operations via voice commands
- **Data Integration**: Retrieve information from Mail, Messages, and other apps to complete tasks

All of these were demonstrated at WWDC in June 2024 but delayed due to technical challenges.

## Technical Details: Apple Foundation Models v10

According to Gurman, the new Siri runs on what Apple internally calls "Apple Foundation Models version 10," featuring approximately 1.2 trillion parameters. The model is hosted on Apple Private Cloud Compute, protecting user data privacy.

## Even Bigger Upgrade Coming This Summer

The iOS 26.4 improvements are just the beginning. Apple plans to announce a complete Siri overhaul, codenamed "Campos," at WWDC in June 2026.

### iOS 27 Siri (Campos)

- **Conversational Interface**: Sustained, back-and-forth conversations like ChatGPT or Claude
- **Apple Foundation Models v11**: Performance competitive with Gemini 3
- **New UI and Architecture**: Rebuilt from the ground up
- **Potential Google Cloud Hosting**: May run directly on Google's infrastructure for faster processing

## Why Google Was Chosen

According to Gurman's reporting, Apple initially considered partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic but ultimately chose Google. By August 2025, Apple found that Gemini technology had improved dramatically, and Google offered favorable financial terms.

A September 2025 court ruling that preserved Apple and Google's $20 billion annual search deal reduced partnership risk. The companies finalized their agreement in November, with Google officially announcing it earlier this month.

## A Turning Point in AI Competition

For Apple, long criticized for Siri's shortcomings, the Gemini partnership marks a major turning point. Rather than insisting on proprietary AI solutions, Apple is adopting competitor technology to catch up in the rapidly evolving AI market.

Target devices will be iPhone 15 Pro and newer, meaning users can expect a significantly smarter Siri within months.
