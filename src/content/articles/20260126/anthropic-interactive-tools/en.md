# Anthropic Launches Interactive Tools: Use Workplace Apps Directly Within Claude

Anthropic announced on January 26, 2026, a new feature called "Interactive Tools" that allows users to operate external services directly within Claude's conversation interface. This enables actions like sending Slack messages or creating Figma diagrams without switching tabs during a Claude conversation.

## What are Interactive Tools?

Interactive Tools embed third-party app UI elements directly within Claude's conversation interface. While previous interactions were primarily text-based instructions and summarized results, this new feature integrates the actual operation screens of external services into Claude.

### Supported Applications

At launch, the following services are supported:

- **Slack (Salesforce)**: Search messages, retrieve conversation context, draft and format messages, review before posting
- **Canva**: Create presentation outlines, edit branding and design in real-time
- **Figma**: Create visual diagrams like flowcharts and Gantt charts in FigJam
- **Box**: Search files, preview documents inline, extract insights from content
- **Clay**: Research companies, find contacts with email and phone info, pull company size and funding data, draft personalized outreach
- **Asana**: Turn chats into projects, tasks, and timelines
- **monday.com**: Manage work, run projects, update boards, assign tasks, visualize progress
- **Hex**: Ask data questions, get answers with interactive charts, tables, and citations
- **Amplitude**: Build analytics charts, explore trends, adjust parameters interactively

Salesforce integration is listed as "coming soon."

## Technical Foundation: MCP Apps

The feature is built on "MCP Apps," an extension of Anthropic's open standard "Model Context Protocol (MCP)." MCP Apps defines how external services provide UI elements that are rendered as sandboxed iframes by the host.

Communication between host and app follows defined protocols, ensuring security while enabling seamless integration.

## Availability and Supported Plans

- **Getting Started**: Select connections labeled "interactive" from claude.ai/directory
- **Supported Platforms**: Web and desktop versions of Claude
- **Eligible Plans**: Pro, Max, Team, Enterprise (free plan not included)
- **Future Support**: Will be available on Claude Cowork

## Similarities to OpenAI's Apps Feature

This feature is similar to OpenAI's "Apps" system, launched in October 2025, with both built on MCP. The Model Context Protocol was introduced by Anthropic in 2024, with Apps support added in November 2025.

## Anthropic's Strong Momentum

According to VentureBeat, this Interactive Tools announcement comes during a period of unusual momentum for Anthropic. Claude Code, the company's developer coding assistant, has gained widespread adoption beyond developers. NVIDIA CEO Jensen Huang called it "incredible," and even Microsoft—which sells the competing GitHub Copilot—has widely adopted Claude Code internally.
