# OpenAI Releases Codex App for macOS with Multi-Agent Coordination

OpenAI has released a new macOS application for Codex, its AI coding assistant, featuring advanced capabilities for coordinating multiple AI agents and managing complex software development projects. The app is now available to ChatGPT Free and Go users for a limited time, with doubled rate limits for paid tiers.

## Multi-Agent Architecture

The new Codex app introduces a multi-agent architecture that allows developers to coordinate multiple AI agents working simultaneously on different aspects of a project. This parallel execution capability enables more efficient handling of complex codebases and long-running software development tasks.

## Key Features

- **Agent Coordination**: Multiple AI agents can be orchestrated to work on different parts of a project simultaneously
- **Parallel Task Execution**: Run multiple coding tasks in parallel for faster project completion
- **Long-Running Project Management**: Built-in support for managing extended software development projects
- **macOS Native Integration**: Designed specifically for the macOS environment

## OpenClaw Connection

The Codex models powering this new app were the same ones used to build OpenClaw, a viral coding demonstration that showcased the capabilities of OpenAI's coding AI. The success of OpenClaw appears to have accelerated the broader release of Codex capabilities to consumers.

## Availability and Pricing

The app is initially available to ChatGPT Free and Go users for a limited promotional period. Paid tier subscribers receive doubled rate limits, providing more extensive access to the multi-agent capabilities.

## Developer Ecosystem Implications

This release signals OpenAI's continued investment in developer tooling and AI-assisted software development. The multi-agent approach represents a shift from single-model interactions to more sophisticated orchestration of AI capabilities, potentially changing how developers approach complex coding tasks.
