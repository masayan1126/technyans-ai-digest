## AI Generation Services Successively Limit Free Usage

In late November 2025, following a surge in demand for AI video and image generation services, OpenAI and Google successively announced restrictions on free usage.

## OpenAI Sora Limitations

OpenAI's video generation AI "Sora" has implemented limits on free video generation.

### Key Changes

- Cap set on video generations for free users
- Additional video generation requires upgrading to a paid plan
- Aims to reduce server load and ensure sustainable service delivery

Since its public release in late 2024, Sora has attracted significant attention for its high-quality video generation capabilities, leading to a rapid increase in users.

## Google Nano Banana Pro Limitations

Google's image generation service "Nano Banana Pro" has also reduced its daily free generation quota.

### Changes

- Free generations: Reduced from 3 per day to 2 per day
- Google warns that "limits may change without notice"
- Standard Nano Banana maintains its 100 free images per day limit

The Pro version specializes in high-resolution, high-quality image generation and has seen particularly strong demand from creators and professional users.

## Thanksgiving Holiday Fuels Demand Surge

The timing of these service restrictions coincided with the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday season.

### Holiday Season Impact

- Surge in individual users during the holidays
- Increased demand for AI-generated content for social media posts
- Server resource load reaching critical levels

## Future Outlook

This development indicates that generative AI services are transitioning from an initial "free and unlimited" model to more sustainable revenue models.

For users, the time may have come to evaluate free plan limitations and consider upgrading to paid plans as needed.
