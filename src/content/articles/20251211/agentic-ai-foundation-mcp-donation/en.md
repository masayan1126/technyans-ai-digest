## Cross-Industry Collaboration

On December 9, 2025, the Linux Foundation announced the establishment of the **Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF)**. The foundation's co-founders include typically competing companies such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Bloomberg, and Cloudflare.

AAIF's mission is to advance AI agent development through a transparent and collaborative open-source ecosystem.

## Three Key Projects

The following three projects were donated to AAIF at its founding:

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
Announced by Anthropic in 2024, MCP is a standard protocol for connecting AI applications to external systems. Often called the "USB-C port for AI," it has rapidly become an industry standard, with Google announcing support at I/O 2025.

### goose
An open-source AI agent framework released by Block in early 2025. It combines language models, extensible tools, and MCP integration to build reliable and trusted agent workflows.

### AGENTS.md
A simple configuration file format provided by OpenAI. When added to a repository, it communicates project-specific instructions to AI coding tools.

## Company Statements

OpenAI stated that "Agentic AI will become one of the most complex software systems we build" and emphasized the importance of open standards. Codex alone has been used for over 2 million GitHub Pull Requests.

Anthropic announced that "MCP has become an industry standard in one year and is now deployed at enterprise scale on AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure." Claude has over 75 MCP connectors, and the company also provides Tool Search and Programmatic Tool Calling for production-scale deployments.

## Future Outlook

AAIF will function as a vendor-neutral space where no single company dominates, enabling systems from different developers to work together seamlessly through open protocols.

Bloomberg commented that they are "committed to extending the MCP specification to enable secure use in compliance with regulated financial services requirements."

As the era of AI agents approaches, industry-wide standardization has officially begun.
