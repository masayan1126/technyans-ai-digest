## A Historic Integration

On December 10, 2025, Adobe announced that its flagship creative tools—**Photoshop**, **Adobe Express**, and **Acrobat**—will be directly integrated into OpenAI's ChatGPT. This enables ChatGPT's 800 million weekly active users to access Adobe's professional tools using natural language.

## Tool Capabilities

### Photoshop
Image editing is now possible directly within ChatGPT. Users can invoke Photoshop's editing features through natural language prompts like "remove the background" or "adjust the color tone."

### Adobe Express
The graphic design tool arrives in ChatGPT. With prompts like "help me create an invitation for my dance party," users can select designs from Adobe's template library and ask ChatGPT to make further edits to copy, layout, and images.

### Acrobat
PDF document operations are now completed within ChatGPT. Editing, conversion, and summarization can all be done through natural language.

## Adobe's Vision

David Wadhwani, President of Adobe Digital Media, stated:

> "We're thrilled to bring Photoshop, Adobe Express and Acrobat directly into ChatGPT, combining our creative innovations with the ease of ChatGPT to make creativity accessible for everyone."

## ChatGPT App Ecosystem Expansion

This integration is part of OpenAI's ChatGPT app program expansion. Companies are rushing to integrate with the ChatGPT platform, and Adobe has become a symbolic example of partnership with OpenAI in this trend.

## Impact on Users

A significant benefit is that users who generate images in ChatGPT can continue editing with Adobe tools without leaving the platform. However, Gizmodo notes that the granular control available in professional apps will still be out of reach, and users should expect occasional hallucinations introduced into their edits.

The AI integration of creative tools is fundamentally changing how creativity works, from professionals to consumers.
