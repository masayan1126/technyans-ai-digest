On November 14, 2025, OpenAI added a new group chat feature to ChatGPT, launching a pilot in four regions including Japan. This feature evolves ChatGPT from a simple AI assistant into a social tool that helps friends and family collaborate.

## Group Chat Feature Overview

### Pilot Regions

Group chat functionality is currently piloting in four regions:

- **Japan**
- **New Zealand**
- **South Korea**
- **Taiwan**

OpenAI plans to refine the feature based on feedback from these regions before rolling it out globally.

### Basic Functionality

Group chat works similarly to messaging app group chats:

- **Group Creation**: Create group conversations with friends and family
- **ChatGPT Participation**: ChatGPT functions as one of the conversation participants
- **Natural Dialogue**: Participates in conversations like human participants

## Key Features

### Powered by GPT-5.1 Auto

Group chat leverages **GPT-5.1 Auto**:

- **Dynamic Model Selection**: Automatically selects optimal model based on prompt
- **Efficient Processing**: Lightweight models for simple questions, high-performance models for complex tasks
- **Cost Optimization**: Allocates appropriate resources as needed

### Smart Conversation Flow

OpenAI focused on teaching ChatGPT to understand group conversation dynamics:

- **Timing Judgment**: Understands when to speak and when to stay quiet
- **Context Awareness**: Follows conversation flow and contributes at appropriate moments
- **Natural Participation**: Blends naturally into conversations like human participants

### Mention Feature

Participants can summon AI anytime by mentioning "ChatGPT":

```
@ChatGPT Any good Italian restaurants nearby?
```

ChatGPT responds not only when explicitly mentioned but also speaks up spontaneously when judged appropriate based on conversation flow.

### Emoji Reactions

ChatGPT can also react with emojis:

- 👍 Agreement or approval
- 😊 Empathy or joy
- 🤔 Thinking
- ✅ Task completed

This makes conversations more natural and social.

### Profile Photo Utilization

ChatGPT recognizes participants' profile photos and can generate personalized images tailored to the conversation.

## Practical Use Cases

OpenAI proposes various applications for group chat functionality.

### 1. Travel Planning

When planning trips with friends or family, ChatGPT supports:

- **Destination Suggestions**: Recommending destinations based on budget and preferences
- **Itinerary Creation**: Creating itineraries matching schedule and budget
- **Booking Information**: Providing hotel and transportation information
- **Translation Support**: Language support for international travel

### 2. Renovation Projects

When planning home renovations:

- **Idea Provision**: Suggesting designs and layouts
- **Budget Estimation**: Calculating approximate costs
- **Contractor Selection**: Points for selecting contractors and checklists
- **Project Management**: Creating task lists and schedules

### 3. Restaurant Selection

When planning group dining:

- **Restaurant Search**: Suggesting restaurants considering everyone's preferences
- **Menu Verification**: Addressing allergies and dietary restrictions
- **Reservation Support**: Reservation notes and information
- **Access Information**: Location and parking details

### 4. Event Planning

Planning birthday parties or gatherings:

- **Theme Suggestions**: Party themes and concepts
- **Shopping List**: Creating lists of needed items
- **Recipe Suggestions**: Food and dessert ideas
- **Game Suggestions**: Party games and activity proposals

### 5. Study Groups

For student or professional study groups:

- **Study Planning**: Creating effective study schedules
- **Concept Explanation**: Explaining difficult concepts clearly
- **Problem Solving**: Supporting assignments and homework
- **Resource Provision**: Recommending additional learning resources

## OpenAI's Social Platform Strategy

Adding group chat functionality signals a major strategic shift for OpenAI.

### Evolution from Simple AI Assistant

ChatGPT is evolving as follows:

- **Personal Tool** → **Collaboration Platform**
- **One-on-One Dialogue** → **Group Communication**
- **Task Assistance** → **Social Experience**

### Integration with Sora 2

In September 2025, OpenAI announced Sora 2:

- **TikTok-Style Feed**: Social media app for AI-generated videos
- **Algorithmic Recommendations**: Recommendations based on user activity and location
- **Parental Controls**: Age restriction features
- **Direct Messaging**: User-to-user messaging functionality

Group chat functionality extends this trend, indicating OpenAI's ambition to establish itself as a social platform.

## Privacy and Security

Group chat functionality raises privacy and security considerations.

### Data Handling

- **Conversation History**: Group chat content may be stored on OpenAI servers
- **Privacy Settings**: Options for users to control data usage
- **Third-Party Sharing**: Transparency about whether data is shared with third parties

### Security Features

- **End-to-End Encryption**: Conversation protection (implementation status requires verification)
- **Group Management**: Managing participant additions and removals
- **Inappropriate Content Filtering**: Detecting and preventing harmful content

## Future Development

OpenAI plans to continuously improve group chat functionality.

### Feedback-Based Improvements

Based on pilot region feedback:

- **Feature Additions**: New features based on user requests
- **UX Improvements**: More intuitive and user-friendly interface
- **Performance Optimization**: Improved response speed

### Global Rollout

After pilot period:

- **Phased Expansion**: Extension to more regions
- **Language Support**: Supporting additional languages
- **Localization**: Addressing region-specific needs

### New Feature Additions

Potential future features:

- **Voice Calls**: Group voice chat
- **Video Calls**: Video conferencing functionality
- **Screen Sharing**: Enhanced collaboration features
- **File Sharing**: Document and image sharing

## Technyan's Comment

"ChatGPT's group chat feature really shows AI becoming a social presence! Being able to ask 'Hey ChatGPT, any recommended autumn foliage spots in Kyoto?' when planning trips with friends is incredibly convenient!

What I find interesting is ChatGPT understanding 'when to speak and when to stay quiet.' Even in human group chats, some people make KY (can't read the air) comments, but AI being trained to read the room properly is amazing!

Using GPT-5.1 Auto to select optimal models based on prompts is smart too. Using lightweight models for simple questions like 'suggest nearby restaurants' and high-performance models for complex tasks like 'create a 3-day Kyoto trip plan' balances cost and performance.

Piloting in Japan is exciting! I'm curious how well ChatGPT understands Japanese nuances and cultural context. For example, can it properly understand and respond to vague expressions like 'a slightly upscale restaurant' or 'casual atmosphere'?

Privacy is a concern though. If group chat content is stored on OpenAI servers, caution is needed for conversations containing personal or confidential information. We need to verify how thoroughly end-to-end encryption is implemented.

Combined with the Sora 2 social media app, OpenAI is positioning AI at the center of social platforms. This shows AI becoming not just a tool, but part of our daily lives.

If voice chat and video call features are added in the future, it could truly rival Zoom and Teams! A future where AI participates in meetings, takes minutes, organizes tasks, and provides additional information is visible! 🚀💬"

## Summary

ChatGPT's group chat feature opens new possibilities for AI assistants:

1. **Pilot in 4 Regions**: Japan, New Zealand, South Korea, Taiwan
2. **GPT-5.1 Auto**: Optimal model selection based on prompts
3. **Smart Conversation Flow**: Understanding when to speak
4. **Diverse Use Cases**: Travel planning, renovations, restaurant selection, etc.
5. **Social Platform Evolution**: OpenAI's strategic shift

This feature evolves ChatGPT from a personal AI assistant into a social tool supporting collaboration with friends and family. It will be refined based on pilot feedback and eventually rolled out globally.

With careful attention to privacy and security, all eyes are on how this new feature integrates into our daily lives. A new era where AI becomes part of social spaces is about to begin.
