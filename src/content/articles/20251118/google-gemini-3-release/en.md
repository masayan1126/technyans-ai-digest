technyanComment: "The release of Gemini 3 symbolizes the fierce competition in the AI industry! Just weeks after OpenAI released GPT-5 and GPT-5.1, and only 24 hours after xAI topped benchmarks with Grok 4.1, Google reclaimed the top spot with Gemini 3. The speed of this competition is incredible. What's particularly notable is that it was integrated into Google Search AI Mode from day one. This is Google's major strength—hundreds of millions of users can immediately access the latest AI model. The improved coding capabilities are also a key point, and when combined with the new Antigravity development platform, developer productivity should significantly increase. However, the bug right after release (getting the current date wrong) is a bit disappointing, but this should be fixed. The race for AI industry leadership is really good for users!"
