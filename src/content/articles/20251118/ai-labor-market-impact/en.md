# Trump Economic Adviser Warns of AI-Induced 'Quiet Time' in Labor Market

## Overview

Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council (NEC) under the Trump administration, has warned that artificial intelligence-driven productivity gains could cause a "quiet time" in the labor market. Companies are finding that AI makes their workers so productive that they are slowing down new hiring.

## Details

### Key Points

- **Phenomenon**: Companies slowing hiring due to AI-driven productivity gains
- **Most Affected**: Entry-level workers, including recent college graduates
- **Economic Indicators**: U.S. GDP grew at a strong pace in Q2 2025
- **Outlook**: This impact is expected to be temporary, with "free markets working it out relatively quickly"

### Hassett's Statement

On CNBC's "Squawk Box," Hassett stated:

"I think that there have been mixed signals in the job market, while seeing really, really positive signals in the output markets"

"Firms are finding that AI is making their workers so productive that they don't necessarily have to hire the new kids out of college and so on"

"There could be a little bit of, almost, quiet time in the labor market"

### Trump Administration's AI Policy

The Trump administration is actively promoting AI industry development through:

1. **Deregulation**: Multiple executive orders reducing regulatory barriers for AI infrastructure development, including data centers
2. **Private Sector Leadership**: AI czar David Sacks stated "no federal bailout for AI"
3. **Market Principles**: Minimizing government intervention while respecting private sector autonomy

### Labor Market Impact Analysis

According to McKinsey research:
- **By 2030 Projection**: Demand for advanced technological capabilities could rise by almost 50%
- **Digital Skills**: Basic digital skills demand may grow by nearly 70%
- **HR Tech Market**: Projected to nearly double from approximately $36 billion in 2024 to $69.9 billion by 2033

### Corporate Adoption Trends

- **Mid-2023**: 19% of CHROs actively planning or deploying GenAI in HR
- **Early 2025**: Surged to 61%

This rapid adoption is accelerating structural changes in the labor market.

### Concerns

1. **Reduced Entry-Level Hiring**: Potential suppression of new graduate recruitment
2. **Widening Skills Gap**: Reduced employment opportunities for those unable to adapt to the AI era
3. **Generational Divide**: Increased barriers for young people entering the labor market

### Optimistic View

Hassett also expressed a more optimistic perspective:

"Because there's so much output growth and income growth, that's the kind of thing that a free market will work out relatively quickly as new ways to spend money emerge"

## Tech-nyan's Comment

"While AI's impact on employment has been discussed before, having a senior administration official acknowledge it publicly is significant. The concern about entry-level positions is real. However, historically, new technologies have initially reduced jobs but ultimately created new roles and industries. Demand will certainly increase for people with AI literacy and skills to collaborate with AI systems. Educational systems need to adapt, and companies should redirect resources freed up by AI efficiency toward new businesses and higher-value work."
