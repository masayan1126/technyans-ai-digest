technyanComment: "This is an important moment when the power balance in the AI industry is shifting! OpenAI has been the leader in the AI race until now, but is facing intense pursuit from Google. Sam Altman warning internally about 'economic headwinds' is unusual. This shows they're truly feeling a sense of crisis. What's particularly interesting is the report that OpenAI was struggling with pre-training. The fact that optimizations stopped working when scaling up during GPT-5 development is a major problem. That's why OpenAI had to focus on reasoning models. The Shallotpeat project is very important as OpenAI's comeback strategy. They're trying to prove that pre-training isn't dead and regain leadership. I think this competition is ultimately good for users. As OpenAI and Google compete with each other, better AI models will be developed faster!"

The battle for leadership in the AI industry has entered a new phase. As Google tops nearly all benchmarks with Gemini 3, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman warned in an internal memo that Google's surge could bring "temporary economic headwinds" to the company. Amid this crisis awareness, OpenAI has launched a new project called "Shallotpeat" to mount a comeback in the AI race.

## Sam Altman's Internal Memo: A Sign of Crisis Awareness

According to an internal OpenAI memo obtained by The Information, Sam Altman frankly acknowledges the threat from competitors.

### Key Contents of the Memo

**Altman's Message:**

- **Economic Headwinds**: Recent AI progress by Google and Anthropic could create "temporary economic headwinds"
- **Shrinking Technical Lead**: OpenAI's technological lead over competitors (like Google and Anthropic) is shrinking
- **Optimistic Outlook**: However, emphasizes that OpenAI is "catching up fast"
- **Future Confidence**: Expects to emerge as the leader in the AI race

### Timing of the Memo

Importantly, this memo was written before the Gemini 3 release.

**Timeline:**

1. **Memo Creation**: Altman issues internal memo before Gemini 3 release
2. **Gemini 3 Release**: November 18, 2025, Google announces Gemini 3
3. **Benchmark Results**: Gemini 3 tops nearly all benchmarks

Altman's concerns became reality with the Gemini 3 release.
