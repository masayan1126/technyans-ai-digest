## 2025: Year of Talent Exodus at OpenAI

According to Business Insider, 2025 has been a year of high-profile departures for OpenAI. Over 12 researchers and executives have moved to Meta's Superintelligence Lab.

## Summer Migration to Meta

Particularly in the summer of 2025, at least seven researchers and scientists joined Meta's Superintelligence Lab. This is part of Mark Zuckerberg's billion-dollar effort to strengthen Meta's AI team.

### Notable Departures

- **Shengjia Zhao** - Co-creator of ChatGPT and GPT-4, became Chief Scientist at Meta Superintelligence Lab. Now working directly with Mark Zuckerberg and Chief AI Officer Alexandr Wang
- **Jason Wei** - OpenAI researcher who moved to Meta Superintelligence Lab
- **Chung** - Along with two colleagues, moved to Meta Superintelligence Lab and commented on LinkedIn about "having so much fun building from a clean slate with a truly talent-dense team"

## Executive Departures Continue

Beyond researchers, the Chief People Officer and Chief Communications Officer also left OpenAI in 2025. The wave of departures following the 2024 restructuring continued, after CTO Mira Murati, Chief Research Officer Bob McGrew, and VP of Research Barret Zoph had already departed.

## Only 2 Founding Members Remain Active

CEO Sam Altman is now one of only two active remaining members of the company's original 11-person founding team. This rapid talent exodus highlights challenges with OpenAI's organizational culture and direction.

## New Phase in AI Supremacy Battle

This mass migration indicates that the superintelligence development race has entered a new phase. Meta is aggressively acquiring OpenAI's top talent and rapidly strengthening its own AI research capabilities. Meanwhile, OpenAI faces a new challenge in talent retention.
