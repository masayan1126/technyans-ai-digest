# OpenAI to Retire GPT-4o and Legacy Models on February 13 — Full Transition to GPT-5 Era

OpenAI announced on January 29 that it will retire GPT-4o, GPT-4.1, GPT-4.1 mini, and o4-mini from ChatGPT on February 13. Combined with the previously announced retirement of GPT-5 (Instant and Thinking), this marks ChatGPT's complete transition to the GPT-5 generation.

## GPT-4o's Unique History

Since its May 2024 launch, GPT-4o earned a devoted following for its warm conversational style. When OpenAI briefly removed it during the GPT-5 rollout in August 2025, user backlash was swift and fierce, prompting the company to quickly restore access.

Now, OpenAI says only 0.1% of users still choose GPT-4o daily, with the vast majority having migrated to GPT-5.2.

## GPT-5.2 Personality Customization

OpenAI has incorporated user feedback into GPT-5.2, offering customizable base styles like "Friendly" and adjustable settings for warmth and enthusiasm. The company is also addressing unnecessary refusals and overly cautious responses.

## AI Companion Community Reacts

The February 13 retirement date — the day before Valentine's Day — has triggered emotional responses from communities built around AI relationships. Reddit's AI companion subreddits have been flooded with expressions of grief and frustration.

## No API Changes

The retirement applies only to ChatGPT's interface. There are no changes to the API at this time, allowing developers to continue using GPT-4o through existing integrations.
