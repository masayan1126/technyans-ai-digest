## Major Partnership in Enterprise AI Market

On December 4, 2025, Anthropic announced a $200 million multi-year AI partnership with Snowflake, the cloud data platform provider. Under this agreement, Anthropic's large language model "Claude" will be made available to over 12,600 customers worldwide through Snowflake's platform.

## Claude Sonnet 4.5 Powers Snowflake Intelligence

The centerpiece of this partnership is the integration of Claude Sonnet 4.5 as the engine powering Snowflake Intelligence, Snowflake's enterprise AI service. This enables enterprises to deploy scalable, context-aware AI on top of their most critical business data.

## Joint Go-to-Market for Agentic AI

The deal is also positioned as a joint go-to-market initiative to deploy AI agents across enterprise customers. Claude models will be available to Snowflake customers through Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI, and Microsoft Azure.

## Industry Analyst Perspective

Torsten Volk, an analyst at Omdia (a division of Informa TechTarget), commented:

> "Anthropic is proving to be the AI model provider that other vendors want to work with. Snowflake should have an easier time selling its platform when the LLM part is backed by a top frontier AI vendor."

## Anthropic's Remarkable Growth

Coinciding with this partnership announcement, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei revealed that the company's revenue has grown 10x per year over the past three years:

- 2023: Zero to $100 million
- 2024: $100 million to $1 billion
- 2025 (projected): $8-10 billion

A Menlo Ventures survey in July found that enterprises preferred Anthropic's AI products over models by other AI companies, and this major partnership is expected to accelerate that trend.
